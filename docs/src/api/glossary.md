### F

  - *Forecast*: Predicted values of a time-varying quantity that commonly features
    a look-ahead and can have multiple data values representing each time period.
    This data is used in simulation with receding horizons or data generated from
    forecasting algorithms. See the article on [`Time Series Data`](@ref ts_data).

  - *Forecast window*: Represents the forecasted value starting at a particular initial time.
    See the article on [`Time Series Data`](@ref ts_data).

### H

  - *Horizon*: Is the duration of all time steps in one forecast. As of PowerSystems.jl
    version 4.0, all horizons in `PowerSystems.jl` are represented as a `Dates.Period`.
    For instance, many Day-ahead markets will have an hourly-[resolution](@ref R) forecast
    for the next day, which would have a horizon of `Dates.Hour(24)` or `Dates.Day(1)`. If the
    forecast included the next day plus a 24-hour lookahead window, the horizon would be
    `Dates.Hour(48)` or `Dates.Day(2)`. See the article on [`Time Series Data`](@ref ts_data).

  - *HRSG*: Heat Recovery Steam Generator

  - *HVDC*: High-voltage DC

### I

  - *IEEET*: IEEE Type I Excitation System.

  - *Injector* or *Injection*: Injectors refer to models that represent how a generator or storage
    device *injects* power or current into the power system. Loads are negative injectors. In
    `PowerSystems.jl`, some components can accept data for both [`StaticInjection`](@ref) and
    [`DynamicInjection`](@ref) models for both [static](@ref S) and [dynamic](@ref D) modeling.

  - *Interval*: The period of time between forecast initial times. In `PowerSystems.jl` all
    intervals are represented using `Dates.Period` types. For instance, in a Day-Ahead market
    simulation, the interval is usually `Hour(24)`.

  - *Initial time*: The first time-stamp in a forecast window. See the article on
    [`Time Series Data`](@ref ts_data).

  - *IPC*: Interconnecting power converter

### L

  - *LCC*: Line Commutated Converter HVDC line

  - *PLL*: Phase-locked loop

  - *PSS*: Power System Stabilizer

  - *PSSE* or *PSS/E*: Siemens' PSS®E Power System Simulator for Engineering

  - *PPA*: Power purchase agreement

  - *PSI*: [`PowerSimulations.jl`](https://sienna-platform.github.io/PowerSimulations.jl/latest/)

  - *PSID*: [`PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl`](https://sienna-platform.github.io/PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl/stable/)

  - *PSLF*: GE Vernova's Positive Sequence Load Flow Software

  - *PSY*: `PowerSystems.jl` (this package)

  - *pu* or *p.u.*: Per-unit

  - *PWM*: Pulse-width modulation. A switching technique used in power converters to synthesize a desired AC output voltage by rapidly toggling switches at a high frequency.

### R

  - *REECB1*: Renewable Energy Electric Controller Type B1
  - *REPCA1*: REPCA1: Renewable Energy Power Controller Type A1
  - *Resolution*: The period of time between each discrete value in a time series. All resolutions
    are represented using `Dates.Period` types. For instance, a Day-ahead market data set usually
    has a resolution of `Hour(1)`, a Real-Time market data set usually has a resolution of `Minute(5)`.

### S

  - *SCRX*: Bus Fed or Solid Fed Static Exciter

  - *SEXS*: Simplified Excitation System model from PSS/E

  - *SIL*: Surge impedance loading

  - *ST*: Steam Turbine

  - *States*: Correspond to the set of inputs, outputs or variables, that evolve dynamically in
    [`PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl`](https://sienna-platform.github.io/PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl/stable/),
    commonly via a differential-algebraic system of equations. In `PowerSystems.jl`, a component
    associated to a `DynamicInjector` (for example an AVR) specifies the set of states that specific
    component requires to be modeled accurately.

  - *Static*: Typically refers to steady state data or models where the power system
    and each of its components are assumed to be operating at a steady state equilibrium point. This
    includes both power flow data for a single time point simulation as well as quasi-static time
    series data and models, where the power system is at an equilibrium point at each time step.
    Static data can be used as the input to single time point power flow models and production
    cost models with, for example, 5-minute, 15-minute, or 1-hour [Resolution](@ref R).
    For contrast, see the definition for [Dynamic](@ref D) data.

  - *STAB*: Speed Sensitive Stabilizing PSS Model

  - *Struct*: A composite data type in Julia that can store multiple values in a single object. See the Julia documentation on [`struct`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#struct)
    and [Composite Types](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Composite-Types).

  - *SVM*: Space vector modulation. A control algorithm for three-phase inverters that represents the desired output voltage as a vector in the complex plane and selects switching states to approximate it, achieving lower harmonic distortion than basic [PWM](@ref D).

### U

  - *UUID*: Universally Unique Identifier. A 128-bit identifier formatted as a 32-character
    hexadecimal string (e.g. `5f180c4c-cd81-4b80-8c60-627c28aef8b0`).

### V

  - *VSCLine*: Voltage-Source Converter HVDC Line

  - *VSM*: Virtual Synchronous Machine

### W

  - *WECC*: Western Electricity Coordinating Council

  - *Window*: A forecast window is one forecast run that starts at one [initial time](@ref I)
    and extends through the forecast [horizon](@ref H). Typically, a forecast data set
    contains multiple forecast windows, with sequential initial times. For example, a
    year-long data set of day-ahead forecasts contains 365 forecast windows

### Z

  - *ZIP load*: A ZIP load model accounts for the voltage-dependency of a load and is primarily used
    for dynamics modeling. It includes three kinds of load: constant impedance (Z), constant current (I),
    and constant power (P), though many dynamics models just use the constant impedance model.
    [`StandardLoad`](@ref) and [`ExponentialLoad`](@ref) are both ZIP load models:
    [`StandardLoad`](@ref) breaks up the load into each of its three components, while
    [`ExponentialLoad`](@ref) expresses the load as an exponential equation.
